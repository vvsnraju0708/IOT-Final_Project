<h1>AR Dragon Simulator</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this project was to create an Augmented Reality (AR) application using Unity that allows users to spawn a dragon when scanning a specific photo. The dragon should be capable of flying and moving in all directions using a joystick asset.</p
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             >
<h2>Use Case</h2>
<ul>
<li>The AR app is crafted to conjure a dragon upon scanning a designated photo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functionalities</h2>
<ul>
<li>A dragon materializes upon successfully scanning the specified photo.</li>
<li>A joystick interface facilitates the control of the dragon's flight and movement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Device Specificity: The app exhibits variance in performance across devices due to specific requirements.</li>

<li>Environmental Conditions: The effectiveness of the AR app is contingent upon ambient lighting and the quality of the scanned photo.</li>

<li>Scalability: The current design supports a singular dragon; accommodating multiple dragons may necessitate further development.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Download <b>Test3.apk</b> application from the Builds folder from the above github files :</li>
  <li>Download 1.jpeg from the assets folder</li>
  <li>Once you download both of these open the application in mobile and scan the image to spawn dragon</li>
  <li>The dragon can be operated wsing the joysick</li>
  <li>Open Unity Hub on your laptop and follow these steps:</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>Add a new project with Unity Editor version 2021.3.33.f1.</li>
    <li>Select the "AR_Dragon_Simulator" folder as your project directory.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>In Unity, navigate to File -> Build Settings -> Build to generate the APK file.</li>
  <li>The APK file is now ready for deployment on your Android device. Install and explore the AR Plant Showcase App.</li>
</ol>
