<h1>AR Dragon Simulator</h1>
<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this project was to create an Augmented Reality (AR) application using Unity that allows users to spawn a dragon when scanning a specific photo. The dragon should be capable of flying and moving in all directions using a joystick asset.</p
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             >
<h2>Use Case</h2>
<ul>
<li>The AR app is crafted to conjure a dragon upon scanning a designated photo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functionalities</h2>
<ul>
A dragon materializes upon successfully scanning the specified photo.
A joystick interface facilitates the control of the dragon's flight and movement.
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Device Specificity: The app exhibits variance in performance across devices due to specific requirements.</li>

<li>Environmental Conditions: The effectiveness of the AR app is contingent upon ambient lighting and the quality of the scanned photo.</li>

<li>Scalability: The current design supports a singular dragon; accommodating multiple dragons may necessitate further development.</li>
</ul>
